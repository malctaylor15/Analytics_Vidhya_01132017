# Analytics_Vidhya_01132016

In this project, I use a data set from analytics vidhya competition. 
 
The goal is to estimate the hourly electrical output of a given region.

We have about 5 years of data (by the hour) for the last 5 years. 


The dependent variable is the electricity consumption. 

In this folder, there are various EDA analyses and submission pipelines.
